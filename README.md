### Description

This project focuses on developing a backend API tailored for a social media application. The API offers functionality to manage users, thoughts, and reactions, catering to various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can be created, updated, and removed, with endpoints provided for tasks such as fetching all users or retrieving a specific user by their unique identifier. Thoughts, which represent user-generated content, can also be manipulated through operations like creation, updating, and deletion. Endpoints are available to access all thoughts or retrieve a specific thought by its ID. Additionally, users can engage with thoughts by adding reactions, each capturing a user's response to a particular thought. Developers can utilize the API to construct feature-rich social media platforms with comprehensive backend support.

### Technologies

Node.js: The backend runtime environment for running JavaScript server-side code.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to create APIs and handle HTTP requests.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage user data, thoughts, and reactions.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.
Express.js Middleware: Middleware functions added to the Express application to handle tasks like parsing incoming requests, managing sessions, and error handling.
JavaScript : The primary programming language used for server-side logic, including route handling, data manipulation, and database interactions.
