# SocialMediaApp

## Description

This project focuses on developing a backend API tailored for a social media application. The API offers functionality to manage users, thoughts, and reactions, catering to various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can be created, updated, and removed, with endpoints provided for tasks such as fetching all users or retrieving a specific user by their unique identifier. Thoughts, which represent user-generated content, can also be manipulated through operations like creation, updating, and deletion. Endpoints are available to access all thoughts or retrieve a specific thought by its ID. Additionally, users can engage with thoughts by adding reactions, each capturing a user's response to a particular thought. Developers can utilize the API to construct feature-rich social media platforms with comprehensive backend support.
